    "I was reading <a href=\"http://distill.pub/2017/momentum/\">this excellent article</a> today and followed one of the references to <a href=\"http://people.math.carleton.ca/~williams/papers/pdf/175.pdf\">this short note</a> on powers of two-by-two matrices. This led me into a <a href=\"\">wikipedia vortex</a> of learning and re-learning linear algebra. I just wanted to jot down some notes on the original two-by-two matrix thing so I don't forget it, and it doesn't seem to be in the <a href=\"http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/pubdb/views/edoc_download.php/3274/pdf/imm3274.pdf\">matrix cookbook</a>."
